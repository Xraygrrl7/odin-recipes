    <h4>Ingredients for Spicy Sriracha Lime Chicken Zoodle Soup</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>8-10 oz. chicken breast (approx. 1 large)</li>
      <li>4 Cups broth (chicken or vegetable)</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp cumin</li>
      <li>1 large zucchini squash</li>
      <li>1/2 TBSP fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>1-2 fresh chopped cilantro</li>
      <li>1-2 tsp Sriracha plus extra to taste</li>
      <li>2 slices/wedges of lime</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut your chicken into slices ad add to a pot over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add broth, garlic powder [or fresh garlic] and cumin and bring to a
        boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer until chicken is cooked thoroughly,
        about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the chicken cooks, use a spiralizer to transform your zucchini
        into tasty noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the chicken is ready, add zucchini noodles and lime juice to the
        soup and simmer for an additional 3 minutes until desired tenderness is
        reached. For softer noodles , feel free to cook them longer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer soup to two large bowls and top each with fresh cilantro and
        healthy serving of sriracha. Add a little or a lot! Serve with lime
        wedges for a burst of flavor!
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy while its nice and hot!</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I like to make my soup super spicy so I add thai peppers to the broth
        while its cooking.
      </li>
      <li>For extra seasoning add green onion to the broth.</li>
      <li>Looking for another vegetable to add try oyster mushrooms</li>
    </ul>
